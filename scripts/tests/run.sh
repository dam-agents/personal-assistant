#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run.sh — offline test runner for the personal-assistant scripts. Discovers and
# runs every scripts/tests/test_*.sh; a test file exits non-zero on failure.
#
# Test conventions (each test_*.sh):
#   - Sandbox: create its own WORK_DIR under a temp dir — never touch a real
#     work/ or $HOME; clean up on exit.
#   - Offline: stub external CLIs by prepending scripts/tests/bin to PATH and
#     placing fake executables there (e.g. a `gh` printing canned JSON per
#     argument pattern). Tests must pass with no network and no credentials.
#   - Determinism: pre-flight logic is pure detection, so identical stub output
#     must yield an identical worklist — assert on the emitted JSON (jq).
#
# A behavior change in a script updates its test case in the same PR
# (docs/self-modification.md §9).
