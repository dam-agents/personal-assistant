# work-backup.sh — durable backup / restore of the shared-volume work/ state to
# the $GITHUB_REPO_WORK remote, performed ENTIRELY inside a private tmpfs clone:
# the home volume is virtiofs-over-NFS, and a .git mutated there under
# concurrent runs produces ESTALE + .nfs* silly-rename corruption — so work/ is
# a plain data directory and git only ever runs in /dev/shm. Rationale:
# docs/persistence.md.
#
#   work-backup.sh persist   # end of run: snapshot work/ -> commit -> push
#   work-backup.sh restore   # fresh volume: remote state -> work/ (data only)
#
# Durability: nothing authoritative lives on tmpfs — live state is work/
# (persistent volume), history is the remote, the clone is disposable scratch
# re-seeded whenever missing or broken. Concurrency: the persist step is
# serialized by a mkdir lock next to the clone (lock-or-skip + stale TTL;
# a skipped persist is safe — work/ is the source of truth and the next run
# backs it up); a rejected non-fast-forward push re-seeds from the new tip and
# retries with a fresh snapshot. work/ files are only ever READ here (tar).
#
# Never fails the run: all error paths exit 0 (a missed backup is retried next
# run). Requires: git, tar. Sources scripts/log.sh when present.
