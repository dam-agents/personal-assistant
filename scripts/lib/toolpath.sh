#!/usr/bin/env bash
# toolpath.sh — resolve shimmed CLI tools to their real binaries, once per shell
# process (a forked subprocess resolves again, served from the cache file).
#
# Source this BEFORE the first `jq`/`gh` call and before any `command -v <tool>`
# guard. Rationale and measurements: docs/logging.md → Tool path resolution.
#
# On the DAM pod `jq` and `gh` on PATH are symlinks to `mise`, which re-resolves
# its toolchain on every invocation (~250ms vs ~17ms for the real binary). A
# pre-flight execs `jq` dozens of times per run and harness hooks fire on every
# tool call, so the tax dominates both. This defines shell functions that call
# the real binary directly.
#
# PATH is deliberately NOT modified: the offline test suite stubs CLIs by
# prepending scripts/tests/bin to PATH, and shadowing that would send the tests
# to the network. A tool already resolving outside */shims/* (test stub,
# operator override, a fixed pod image) is left untouched.
#
# Degrades silently: unresolvable tools keep working through the shim. Never
# fails a run — this is a speed optimization, not a dependency. The shim itself
# is an environment defect owned by the pod image (docs/self-modification.md
# §5a); the audit's `tool_shims` check keeps reporting it until that lands.

# Cache the resolved paths: `mise bin-paths` costs ~210ms, an [ -x ] test ~0.6ms.
