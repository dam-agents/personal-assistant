# config.sh — the one reader for `work/CONFIG.md`. Sourced by every script that
# reads configuration: `preflight.sh` (the runtime) and `verify-onboarding.sh`
# (which judges the file the runtime will read).
#
# It lives here, once, because the two must agree byte for byte. A verifier that
# parses a value differently from the runtime passes a file the runtime then
# mis-parses — and two copies of a function drift silently, so there is one.
# Expects $CONFIG to be set by the caller.

# The contract these implement is stated in CLAUDE.md → **Runtime configuration**;
# change it here and there in the same PR, never in one alone.

# surrounding whitespace and one layer of surrounding quotes/backticks are stripped.
