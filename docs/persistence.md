# Persisting `work/` & evolving the definition

Read this file when you need the details behind the end-of-run backup, when the owner
asks to update the agent or check its version, or when they ask for a change to the agent
definition itself.

## Two stores: shared live state + durable backup

| Path | Kind | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/home/agent` (outer) | git repo, remote `$DEFINITION_REPO` (`origin`) | Definition: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `README.md`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`. |
| `/home/agent/work` | **plain data directory** (no `.git`) | Live runtime state. Shared across concurrent runs; the source of truth. |
| `$GITHUB_REPO_WORK` | git remote | Durable, versioned **backup** of `work/`. Written only via a disposable tmpfs clone (below). |

`work/` is **never** a git repo: the home volume is virtiofs over NFS, and a `.git`
mutated there under concurrent runs produces `Stale file handle` (ESTALE) and `.nfs*`
silly-rename corruption. All git plumbing happens off the shared volume, in a tmpfs
clone under `/dev/shm`; `work/` itself is only ever read.

The outer `.gitignore` is an allowlist (`/*` then re-include the definition files), so
**all** of `work/` and the HOME secrets (`.ssh`, `.claude`, `.config`) are invisible to
the outer repo. A fresh volume seeds state files from the templates in `ONBOARDING.md`
or restores them from the backup remote; a definition update (fast-forward, or a hard
reset when the checkout diverged) never collides with live runtime state. **Never run
`git clean` in `/home/agent`** and never `git add` outside the allowlist (the backup's
`git add -A` is confined to the tmpfs clone, never the home tree).

## Backup & restore (`scripts/work-backup.sh`)

Pre-flight scripts never commit or push — their local bookkeeping is written straight to
the `work/` files and stays on the volume until backed up. At the end of every run where
the agent did work, as the very last action and only when `$GITHUB_REPO_WORK` is set:

```bash
LOG_JOB=<mode> bash "$HOME/scripts/work-backup.sh" persist
```

The script (full rationale in its header) snapshots the current `work/` files into a
**disposable tmpfs clone**, commits, and pushes. Nothing authoritative lives on tmpfs —
live state is `work/`, history is the remote, and the clone is re-seeded whenever
missing or broken, so a pod restart wiping `/dev/shm` never matters. The persist step is
serialized by a mkdir lock next to the clone (lock-or-skip: a skipped persist is safe —
the running one snapshots the same shared `work/` moments later, and the next run sweeps
up any remainder); a rejected non-fast-forward push re-seeds from the new remote tip and
retries with a fresh snapshot. Never force-push; a push that fails all retries is logged
and retried next run — not a run failure, because the data is safe on `work/`.

**The backup remote holds one person's tasks, notes, and preferences.** It must be a
**private** repository owned by the same person or their organization, and it is the only
place `work/` data ever leaves the agent besides the owner's own channel (`CLAUDE.md` →
**Hard invariants**). Without `$GITHUB_REPO_WORK` the state lives on the volume alone —
durable across pod restarts, lost with the volume, and not reconstructable from anywhere:
nothing here mirrors the owner's list into an external system.

`restore` is the inverse — remote → `work/` (data only, never a `.git`) — run once on a
fresh volume (`ONBOARDING.md` Step 2a).

## Definition version & upgrade

`VERSION` (repo root, one line, semver) identifies the definition; `work/VERSION` is the
version this instance last adopted (missing = `1.0.0`). Scheduled runs never touch
versioning (the weekly audit only *reports* drift); acting happens **in the direct
session only**: an owner-requested update or version check, and always before any
self-modification (self-modification.md §8).

**Check:**

```bash
git -C /home/agent fetch -q origin main
git -C /home/agent show origin/main:VERSION 2>/dev/null | head -1   # latest
head -1 /home/agent/VERSION                                         # checked out
head -1 /home/agent/work/VERSION 2>/dev/null                        # adopted
```

Checked-out < latest → **tell the owner the agent is not up to date** (state both
versions); update only when they ask, never silently, then migrate in the same session.
Adopted ≠ checked-out → migrate now. All equal → report "up to date".

Update a clean checkout by **fast-forward** — it reaches the same commit without
discarding anything, so it also passes an auto-mode guard that refuses destructive
commands:

```bash
git -C /home/agent status --porcelain          # must be empty; otherwise stop and ask
git -C /home/agent merge --ff-only origin/main \
  || git -C /home/agent reset --hard origin/main   # only when the checkout diverged
```

The fallback is for a diverged checkout (a platform reset, an abandoned local commit) —
it discards, so surface that it was needed. **Never `git clean`.**

**Migration** (`from` = adopted, `to` = checked-out):

1. Apply the `CHANGELOG.md` **Upgrade** blocks of every version in `(from, to]`, oldest
   first. Steps are idempotent (check before create), so re-running a partial attempt is
   safe; an owner-only step is surfaced, never guessed at.
2. **Offer every optional feature the crossed versions add.** An **Upgrade** block that
   introduces an off-by-default feature names the `work/CONFIG.md` key that enables it
   and its one-line effect (self-modification.md §12); upgrading never adopts it by
   itself. Collect them across all crossed versions and ask the owner **once, in one
   message**. A yes writes that key; a no or no answer writes nothing — the missing key
   is the documented off default — and the migration continues either way. Never enable
   a feature the owner did not confirm.
3. Only after every applicable step succeeded, write `to` into `work/VERSION` and log
   `definition upgraded <from> → <to> (<n> step(s))`, naming the features offered and
   the answers. A failed step: log + tell the owner, leave `work/VERSION` unchanged
   (re-offered at the next check).
4. Rollback (`to` < `from`) → apply nothing, offer nothing; just write `to`.

Whenever an upgrade changes what onboarding produces, its **Upgrade** block runs
`bash "$HOME/scripts/verify-onboarding.sh"` and applies every `FAIL` line's `fix:` — the
same verification onboarding ends with, and the only thing that keeps a long-deployed
instance the same shape as a fresh one.

Back up `work/` afterwards (section above).

## Evolving the agent definition (outer repo)

**First read [self-modification.md](self-modification.md)** — it defines the rules every
definition change must obey.

The repo reference is `$DEFINITION_REPO` when the session exported it, otherwise
`definition_repo` from `work/CONFIG.md` ([config.md](config.md)) — a scheduled shell has no
exports.

Definition changes go through **branch + PR on that repo — never a direct push
to `main`, never auto-merge**, and only when deliberately asked — never as part of a
scheduled run:

```bash
git -C /home/agent fetch origin main
git -C /home/agent checkout -b "fix/<short-slug>" origin/main
git -C /home/agent add -- CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md ONBOARDING.md README.md VERSION CHANGELOG.md .gitignore LICENSE docs scripts .github
git -C /home/agent commit -m "<describe the change>"
git -C /home/agent push -u origin "fix/<short-slug>"
gh pr create --repo "$DEFINITION_REPO" --base main --head "fix/<short-slug>" \
  --title "<title>" --body "<what and why>"
```

The agent's job ends at "PR opened". Use fresh descriptive branch names; runtime state
never goes to this repo.

The definition repo may sit on a different host than the systems the agent works on, so
**every definition-repo call names its host** — `-R "$DEF_HOST/$DEFINITION_REPO"` for
`gh pr`/`gh issue`, `--hostname "$DEF_HOST"` for `gh api`. The outer-repo `origin` URL
already carries it, so plain `git fetch`/`push` need nothing extra.
